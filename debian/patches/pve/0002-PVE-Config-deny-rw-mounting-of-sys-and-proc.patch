Subject: [PATCH lxc] PVE: [Config] deny rw mounting of /sys and /proc

Note that we don't actually make use of this anymore, since
we switched to the generated profiles which already do this.

this would allow root in a privileged container to change
the permissions of /sys on the host, which could lock out
non-root users.

if a rw /sys is desired, set "lxc.mount.auto" accordingly
